# mazeAndroidApp
A project in my fourth semester with a teammember.

We had to create a randomized maze game of skill in Android Studios with java. The ball in the maze has to be controlled with the smartphone sensors or with a esp32-microcontroller. The code for the esp32 has to be written in Arduino, we also had to write code for a timer, which should be hardware based. We also needed temperature and location sensors, these values and the time had to be sent to a mqtt broker, where the app can receive the values there for the game.

The time and the name of the players should be saved in a leaderboard, which we had to create with a SQLite database.

For the random generation of the maze we should use ChatGPT, so we can learn how to work with it.

Like always, it it not perfect and i'm always learning !!
